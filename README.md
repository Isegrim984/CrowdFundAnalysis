# CrowdFundAnalysis
Final Project of my Big Data Analytics course at Alfatraining in November 2021

Origin of raw data is unknown.

The task was as follows:  
You work as a data scientist in a start-up. You opened your business a year ago and now you want to take the next step and expand your services. Your business model is to operate a platform where people who have a business idea but do not have the required money can register and collect money for their project within a given time. On the other hand, you have financiers who would like to invest their money in projects and who are looking for investments. As an intermediary, your platform brings together borrowers and donors. You earn your money with a commission for every project that lands on your platform.
